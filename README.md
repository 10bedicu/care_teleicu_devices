## Local Development

To develop the plug in local environment along with care, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the care root directory and clone the plugin repository:

```bash
cd care
git clone git@github.com:ohcnetwork/care_teleicu_devices.git
```

2. Add the following plug configuration to your `plug_config.py` file to enable the plugins locally:

```python
from plugs.manager import PlugManager
from plugs.plug import Plug

plugs = [
    Plug(
        name="gateway_device",
        package_name="/path/to/care_teleicu_devices", # for local development, point this to the absolute path to the cloned plug repository
        version="",
        configs={},
    ),
    Plug(
        name="camera_device",
        package_name="/path/to/care_teleicu_devices", # for local development, point this to the absolute path to the cloned plug repository
        version="",
        configs={},
    ),
    Plug(
        name="vitals_observation_device",
        package_name="/path/to/care_teleicu_devices", # for local development, point this to the absolute path to the cloned plug repository
        version="",
        configs={},
    ),
]

manager = PlugManager(plugs)
```

3. Tweak the code in plugs/manager.py to update the pip install command with the -e flag for editable installation

```python
subprocess.check_call(
    [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-e", *packages] # add -e flag to install in editable mode
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not push these changes in a PR. These changes are only for local development.

4. Install the plugins

```bash
python install_plugins.py
```

5. Rebuild the docker image and run the server

```bash
make re-build
make up
```
